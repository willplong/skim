    "1. Why does the Gaussian scale mixture prior promote sparsity of the regression coefficients $\\theta$?\n",

    "The method SKIM from the paper's section 6 has been implemented in jax/Numpyro [here](https://pyro.ai/numpyro/examples/sparse_regression.html). Review the code and recognize how the theoretical concepts of the Kernel Interaction Trick and the specific features of SKIM have been implemented. Then copy the code to this notebook and modify it so that you can execute the provided test example inline. Confirm that you get a result comparable to theirs.\n",

    "The last step of their example analysis (sampling from the posterior with the method `sample_theta_space`) often returns `nan`s. It also reports the posterior for all $\\theta$ (active and inactive ones), and only for one sample at a time. That's really clunky. Modify this function to produce valid posterior samples of $\\theta$ from all the $\\tau$ samples from the MCMC step, but restrict yourself to the active direct and pairwise interaction terms. Visualize the posterior from the example with `corner`."

    "Find an application from your area of research where the kernel-interaction method is directly applicable, or could be applied with some modification. Describe the application for a statistically knowledgeable but non-expert audience (think: your peers in SML 505). In particular, explain why the sparse interaction ansatz is justified. Then demonstrate the use with a suitable data set of your own choice. Explain what you find.\n",
